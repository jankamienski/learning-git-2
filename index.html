          <h3>Mr. President</h3>
          <p>Ayyayaya coco jambo ayyayai<br>
          Ayyayaya coco jambo ayyayai </p>
          <p>Put me up, put me down<br>
          Put my feet back on the ground<br>
          Put me up, take my heart<br>
          And make me happy</p>
          <p> Put me up, put me down<br>
          Put my feet back on the ground<br>
          Put me up, feel my heart<br>
          And make me happy</p>
          <p>Here we go, gettin' smooth to the groove<br>
          Watching lovely ladies, how I sooth as I move<br>
          'Cause that's what they say but I can't prove<br>
          So turn it up again and watch me move to the groove</p>
          <p>As we get close, you whisper coco<br>
          I hold you in my arms and you say "Jamboo"<br>
          Scream and shout, turn and say Colombo<br>
          Now I gotta go so coco</p>
          <p> Put me up, put me down<br>
          Put my feet back on the ground<br>
          Put me up, take my heart<br>
          And make me happy</p>
          <p>Put me up, put me down<br>
          Put my feet back on the ground<br>
          Put me up, feel my heart<br>
          And make me happy</p>
          <p>Ayyayayaâ€¦</p>
